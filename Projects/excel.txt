@  i need tocreate a new col which will add the   "pokeball" and "great ball"

@ ceiling-> count the cell

@ first we have to give = into the cell and must have to give
name formula

@in this case we can give =cel_name1 + cel_name2 + cel_name3

and this formula we have to put into a column

@B3+C3+D3 or first cell formula and drag rest automatically will be updated or =AVERAGE(A1:A20)

@AVERAGE= B3+C3+D3/3

@> GREATER THAN
@< LESSER THAN
@>= GREATER THAN EQUAL TOO
@<= LESSER THAN EQUAL TOO
EG:  B3>C3
     B3<C3
     B3<=C3
     B3>=C3
